# Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Artificial Intelligence**: The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by Humans.
Older generation AI were simple bots hard coded, every rule was hard coded into them, they followed the rules and steps coded by us

**Machine Learning** on the other hand figures out the rules for us, they take out the outputs and figure out the rules. We give machine learning data and outputs and it figures out the rules.

Machine Learning can make mistakes and so our goals while making machine learning models is to get highest accuracy possible.

**Neural Networks:** Transforms input data before giving the output. Multi-stage information extraction model. (Not modeled after the brain) They just process the input through layers of rules to extract a lot more information from the inputted data. 

### Data
Data is very important, we require data to make any model. We give features to the model and get label (output). We first train models with a training set which contains features and labels. Then the model makes a set of rules according to these features and then predicts the labels, in the Test set.
