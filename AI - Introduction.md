# AI - Introduction

**What is AI?**

  

AI isn’t some complex line of code or just a fancy word. AI is meant for everything that is artificial and has intelligent behaviour. 

For AI, what looks easy is hard and what looks hard is easy - the example of this is as follows:

1. Easy but hard: picking up something can be very hard for a computer to do on its own bc the object it tries to pick can be of any weight, density, and no matter how much visual interpretation it does, it can never be too sure of how much energy to use before picking it up or knowing its actual weight/density, etc.
2. Hard but easy: solving maths or playing chess, which seems hard to a normal human, is very easy for a computer bc it can run billions of computations in seconds within a given set of rules.

Note: AI is not a countable noun, so you can’t say ‘an AI’. 

  

**Relatable fields**

  

Machine learning:  can be defined as systems which learn from data and experiences and improve its own efficiency and accuracy.

  

Deep learning: is a subset of machine learning, it generally uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain to learn. It has layers to it to understand itself better; these layers are called neural networks.

  

Data Science: is the entire movie production in which the director is a data scientist, who watches and directs everything; the script (data) is the raw, main material, special effects (ML/DL) the tool that makes the raw script refined, attractive, and gives insight.
